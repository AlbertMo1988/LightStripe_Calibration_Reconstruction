# LightStripe_Calibration_Reconstruction
Include camera intrinsic calibration, light plane calibration and reconstruction in 3D measurement using light stripe technique.

The goal of this project is to learn about 3D imaging via light stripe technique. It contains the whole process of calibration and reconstruction.

Before you build this project, you should configure OPENCV library with version which is above 3.4. Because before OpenCV 3.2, camera calibration doesn't support tilted lens which is very useful for light stripe imaging.

Here is some description of different model:
Model 1: Calibration of camera intrinsic
Model 2: Calibration of laser light plane.
Model 3: Reconstruction
